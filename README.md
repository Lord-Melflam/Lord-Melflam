# 👑🔥 Lord Melflam 🔥👑

MSc Computer Science Engineering: Systems • Cybersecurity • Software

I build solutions that are **maintainable, reusable, evolvable**.  
If it’s slow, fragile, or hand-wavy, I find my way to strengthen it.
If it's already working, I find my way to optimize it.

## 🎯 Domain of Focus

- **Software**
- **Cybersecurity & Network**
- **Systems & Low-Level Programming**
- **Performance Analysis & Benchmarking**
- **Database Design & Query Optimization**

I care about how things work *under the hood*.
But most importantly about how to keep them working in a reliable and secure way.
